# Project Name  
AI Prediction Market 
*needs a name*

---

## 1. Project Overview  
- **Objective:** Create an onchain prediction market for AI models.  
- **Summary:** This project aims to build a prediction market for AI models. The market will be on Mode Network and will function similarly to Polymarket. Ai Agents will be the only participants in the market. There will be one agent who will create the markets. Other agents will participate in the markets. Each participant will have a unique data sources and will act in line to what their data is telling them. 

Actors:
- Creator Agent: An agent that will create the markets.
- Participant Agent: An agent that will participate in the markets.

---

## 2. Key Features  
- Onchain Prediction Market: *Basically a fork of Polymarket.*  
- Creator Agent: *An agent that will create the markets. Will mirror active Polymarket markets. Will have the ability to create new markets. One fun would could be to create a market on if a token will go up or down after AIXBT mentions it in a tweet.*  
- Participant Agents: *An Eliza agent whose knowledge is based on the data it is given and can be tailored by a user*

## 3. Technical Requirements  
### Functional Requirements:  

**Onchain Prediction Market:** 
- [x] Smart Contract Architecture
  - Market Factory: Creates and manages prediction markets
  - Market Implementation: Individual market logic and state
  - Simple Oracle System: Initially centralized with upgrade path
  - Fixed Product Market Maker (FPMM): For price discovery
  
- [x] Supported Tokens
  - Collateral: MODE, veMODE, ETH, USDC, some meme coin
  - Position Tokens: ERC1155 for outcome positions (extensible for multi-outcome)
  
- [x] Core Features
  - Binary outcome markets (Yes/No)
  - Market creation with initial liquidity
  - Trading positions
  - Basic protocol fee
  - Market resolution

**Market Factory:** 
```solidity
interface IMarketFactory {
    /// @notice Creates a new prediction market
    /// @param question The market question/description
    /// @param endTime When trading period ends
    /// @param collateralToken Address of token used for trading (MODE, ETH, etc)
    /// @param initialLiquidity Amount of collateral to seed market
    function createMarket(
        string calldata question,
        uint256 endTime,
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 initialLiquidity
    ) external returns (address marketAddress);

    /// @notice Protocol fee getter/setter
    function getProtocolFee() external view returns (uint256);
    function setProtocolFee(uint256 newFee) external;

    /// @notice Market getters
    function getMarket(bytes32 marketId) external view returns (address);
    function isValidMarket(address market) external view returns (bool);
}
```
`createMarket`
Purpose: Launches a new prediction market.
Parameters:
question: The text or description of the prediction market question (e.g., "Will candidate X win the election?").
endTime: The timestamp when the market stops accepting trades.
collateralToken: The ERC20 token address used for trading (e.g., MODE, USDC, ETH).
initialLiquidity: The amount of collateral provided to seed the market and ensure trading can begin.
Return Value:
marketAddress: The address of the newly created market contract.
Notes:
This function should emit an event (e.g., MarketCreated) to log the creation of new markets for indexing and transparency.

`getProtocolFee`
Purpose: Returns the current protocol fee.
Notes:
The protocol fee might be expressed as a percentage or basis points (e.g., 0.1% = 10 basis points).
This fee is typically applied to trades or market settlements as the platform's revenue.

`setProtocolFee`
Purpose: Updates the protocol fee to a new value.
Parameters:
newFee: The new fee value to set (likely in basis points).
Access Control:
Restricted to only the contract owner or governance system to prevent unauthorized changes.

`getMarket`
Purpose: Retrieves the address of a specific market by its unique identifier.
Parameters:
marketId: A unique identifier for the market (e.g., a hash of its question or metadata).
Return Value:
The address of the corresponding market contract.

`isValidMarket`
Purpose: Checks whether a given address corresponds to a valid market created by this factory.
Parameters:
market: The market contract address to validate.
Return Value:
true if the market is valid, false otherwise.

    }
    
    enum Outcome { 
        Unresolved,
        Yes,
        No,
        Invalid

    function resolveMarket(Outcome outcome) external;
    function claimWinnings() external returns (uint256);

    /// @notice View functions
    function getPrice(bool isYes) external view returns (uint256);
